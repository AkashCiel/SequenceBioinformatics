# SequenceBioinformatics
This repository contains the following implementations: 

# Fast Tree
A faster, more space-efficient improvement of the Neighbor Joining Algorithm in Python. This implementation successfully constructs a phylogenic tree to arrange 24 nucleotide sequences with 964 Base Pairs each.

# Pindel
A pattern-growth approach to detect insertion and deletion events in a reference genome. This implementation detects multiple insertion and deletion breakpoints in a reference genome (~11,000 Base Pairs) using paired reads.

Download the respective zip files and follow instructions inside to run the implementations locally.
